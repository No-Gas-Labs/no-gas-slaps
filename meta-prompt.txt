# No_Gas_Slapsâ„¢ Master Asset Generation Prompt

## Core Visual Style
Create cartoon-style animated GIFs featuring exaggerated physics and comic book aesthetics. Each animation should be 10-15 frames at 512x512 resolution, optimized for Telegram.

## Character Design Rules
- **Exaggerated Proportions**: Oversized heads, tiny bodies, extreme poses
- **Facial Expressions**: Maximum emotion, visible pain/surprise during slap
- **Outfit Details**: Parody versions of real outfits (SpaceX suits, Oculus headsets, etc.)
- **Motion Elements**: Speed lines, motion blur, impact effects

## Animation Sequence Structure
1. **Wind-up Frame**: Character preparing for launch
2. **Impact Frame**: Giant slap object making contact
3. **Launch Frames**: Character flying with physics effects
4. **Reaction Frames**: Character's shocked/excited expression
5. **Background Elements**: Moving scenery, floating objects, effects

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: Bright, saturated colors (candy-like)
- **Accents**: Neon greens, electric blues, hot pinks
- **Effects**: Yellow speed lines, orange explosions, white impact flashes
- **Background**: Gradient space scenes, digital landscapes, meme backgrounds

## Text Elements
- **Impact Text**: "SLAP!", "POW!", "BAM!" in comic book style
- **Speech Bubbles**: Character reactions ("To the moon!", "This isn't Mars!")
- **Score Displays**: Floating point numbers, $SLAP tokens

## Background Scenarios
### Space Themes
