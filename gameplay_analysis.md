# Burrito Bison Gameplay Analysis for No_Gas_Slapsâ„¢

## Core Launch Mechanics
- **Launch System**: Spinner-based power meter (perfect timing = maximum distance)
- **Initial Velocity**: Determined by timing accuracy on launch meter
- **Arc Physics**: Parabolic trajectory with gravity and air resistance
- **Momentum Conservation**: Speed decreases gradually unless boosted

## Bounce & Collision Physics
- **Gummy Bear Interactions**:
  - Standard gummies: Provide bounce boost (+speed)
  - Police gummies: Slow down significantly (danger element)
  - Special gummies: Unique effects (rockets, pogo sticks, balloons)
- **Floor Bounces**: Lose speed on ground contact
- **Chain Combos**: Multiple rapid bounces create momentum multipliers

## Visual Style Elements
- **Cartoon Exaggeration**:
  - Oversized character proportions
  - Speed lines and motion blur during fast movement
  - Comic-style impact effects (POW!, BAM!, stars)
  - Stretch and squash physics on character
- **Color Palette**: Bright, candy-like colors with high saturation
- **Background Parallax**: Multiple scrolling layers for depth

## Player Feedback Loops
- **Immediate Rewards**: Coins spray from defeated enemies
- **Progressive Upgrades**: Elastic cables, bounce power, resistance
- **Achievement System**: Perfect launches, distance milestones
- **Visual Progress**: Character visual changes with upgrades

## Speed & Momentum System
- **Speed Visualization**: Underwear meter shows current velocity
- **Critical Speed**: Required to break through doors/walls
- **Acceleration Sources**: 
  - Rocket power-ups
  - Pogo stick bounces
  - Bomb explosions
  - Balloon floating

## RNG Elements
- **Power-up Spawns**: Random placement of special gummies
- **Cash Multipliers**: Random high-value targets
- **Combo Opportunities**: Chain reaction potential varies

## Progression Gates
- **Door Breaking**: Speed thresholds to advance areas
- **Upgrade Costs**: Exponential scaling for late-game
- **Skill Recharge**: Based on coins collected, not time
